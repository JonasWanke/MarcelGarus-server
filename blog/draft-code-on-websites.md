# A Word About Code Sections on Websites

I often encounter websites that contain some piece of code.
Of course I know that viewing code on a phone is bound to be a sub-par experience compared to desktop screens in any way.
But there is one little attention-to-detail thing I noticed in the way code sections are displayed that makes the already-not-great experience into an abysmal one: The paddings.

On those little phone screens, especially horizontal screen real estate is really precious.
So I die a little every time a site decides it needs to have the normal desktop-adjusted padding on the edge of the website and in return offer me lots of scrolling content.

Yes, I know I'm on a phone and viewing code is difficult â€“ but do you have to actively make it worse?
