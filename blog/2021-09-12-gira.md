# Reverse engineering the Gira HomeServer

We have a pretty fancy home:
There are extra wires in the walls that are used as a [KNX](https://www.knx.org) bus – a system to control lights, thermostats, shades, and power outlets in our home.
All devices and switches actually contain a microcontroller that can send and receive messages using the KNX bus wire.
For example, light switches emit messages for turning a light on or off and lamp sockets listen for those commands to turn the electricity for the lamps on and off.

This is more flexible approach compared to traditional cabling approaches, because switches can be added anywhere on the bus without requiring recabling – we could add a switch that toggles lights on the other side of the house.
Here's a comparison of how the cabling looks like:

--snip--

A system such as this also opens up the possibility of automation:
If you hook a computer up to the KNX bus, it can track which lights are turned on and off and also itself control all devices in the home.
Contrary to the recent wave of "smart home" devices, this works entirely locally without any internet connection.
And cheaper "dumb" lamps are perfectly fine to buy, because the electric grid itself is smart.

In April 2017, we got a [Gira HomeServer](https://www.gira.com/en/en/products/lighting-control/app-controlled-lighting/gira-homeserver), which is a computer that connects to both the KNX bus wire as well as our local network.
Here's an image of it sitting in a closet:

The server enables us to control everything using [an app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.gira.homeserver.android):

The app looks a _bit_ dated, so naturally, I tried to write my own app for it.
Let the reverse engineering begin!

## Reverse engineering how the app talks to the Gira HomeServer

First, I installed the [Gira HomeServer app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.gira.homeserver.android) on an Android emulator and looked the communication between the app and the server sitting in our home.
This server listens for requests to `/QUAD/LOGIN` and then communicates using a strange homebrewed protocol.
Here's a part of the setup communication – apparently the app developers were really into the pipe character (`|`):

```txt
<- 100||
-> 90|Marcel|
<- 91|245013621|
-> 92|A335F32830EAFB1534DE46EFEECF1A8C|
<- 93|1631189318.7.777.284968294|1623684493.49|1|10||000AB3026D30|20170718095820834
-> 1|18039|1
<- 1|18039|1.0|0
<- 1|15883|718.0|0
<- 1|18086|1.0|0
<- 1|18039|1.0|0
<- 1|15883|719.0|0
-> 94||
<- 2|18037|0.0|0
<- 2|18038|0.0|0
<- ...
-> 1|18039|0
<- ...
```

Apparently, each message has a type (the `txt:90`, `txt:91` etc.) and then some arguments.
After some careful testing, performing operations in the app and looking what gets sent, I figured out the meaning of most messages.
In natural language, the conversation looks something like this:

![comic](https://github.com/marcelgarus/server/raw/main/blog/images/gira-comic.png)

The message types `txt:100`, `txt:90`, `txt:91`, `txt:92`, and `txt:93` are all authentication-related.
`txt:100` corresponds to the server asking for a username. `txt:90` provides that username. `txt:91` asks for a password hash using the given salt (a random string of characters) and `txt:93` sends the hash.

Salted password hashing is used so that other listening devices on the WiFi can't pick up the password.
Basically, the server thinks of some random characters and both the server as well as the client do some complicated irreversible math on both the salt and the password.
The client only responds with the password hash.
Would malicious devices that don't know the password attempt to connect to the server, they would be given a different salt, so they can't do the calculation themselves and are unable to respond with the correct salt.

I extracted the math for calculating the hash by decompiling the HomeServer Android app.
It doesn't look like a well-established crytography algorithm though and makes heavy use of the [cryptographically insecure MD5 hashing function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5).
Here's a version of the hash function written in Dart:

```dart
String _createHash(String username, String password, String saltString) {
  final salt = saltString.encodeUtf8();
  final a = [for (var i = 0; i < 64; i++) salt.at(i, or: 0) ^ 92].decodeUtf8();
  final b = [for (var i = 0; i < 64; i++) salt.at(i, or: 0) ^ 54].decodeUtf8();
  var hash = md5('$b$username$password'.encodeUtf8()).bytes.encodeHex().toUpperCase();
  return md5('$a$hash'.encodeUtf8()).bytes.encodeHex().toUpperCase();
}
```

After the client is authenticated, it can send a message of type `txt:1` with a device ID as well as a state.
This will actually change the state of devices.
For example, `txt:1|18039|1` corresponds to "Set the device with ID 18039 (our kitchen light) to status 1 (on)."

By default, the server sends all changes to devices to the client – that's why the server responds with confirmation messages in the transcript above.
Using the message `txt:94`, the client can also explicitly request an update of all device states.

I used the received device updates to create a mapping from our devices to their IDs.
Some devices, like shutters, also consist of multiple IDs – turning one ID on or off makes it go up or down, and setting the other stops the shade.
(Yes, that feels like an ugly workaround.)

Given I can now control the devices in our home, it's time to get working on the new app!

## A better app

I wrote a simple app in Flutter that lets us virtually navigate through rooms and toggle the devices in each room.
Unlike in the official app, devices are roughly displayed in a layout that corresponds to their actual placement in the physical world.
It also automatically adjusts the orientation to the real world according to the device's compass:

## Adding 35 smart devices to our Google Assistant

We have a few Nest Home devices, so I thought it would be a fun exercise to integrate our lamps in that.

Google Assistant has the concept of a [Home Graph](https://developers.google.com/assistant/smarthome/concepts/homegraph).
By registering as a smart appliance maker, I was able to make Google contact a little Raspberry Pi server every time we say something like "Hey Google, turn on the bathroom lights."
Complicated queries like "Turn on all lights in the bedroom" automatically get mapped to multiple requests to the Raspberry Pi.
This Raspberry Pi in turn communicates directly with the Gira HomeServer.

## Conclusion

Reverse engineering is fun!
Analyzing network traffic and decompiling apps to figure out how everything works feels like solving a big real-world puzzle.
