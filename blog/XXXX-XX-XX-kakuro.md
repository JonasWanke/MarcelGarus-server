## Naive

## Gradual

can solve Wikipedia example for easy Kakuro

## Early abort

can solve Book example, but takes an hour

## Prioritize

no real benefit, actually slower?

## Divide

Efficient MinCut for n-ary graphs? -> contact me

## Lazy

don't actually construct results until needed

## Generating inputs with arbitrary size

## Profiling

## Conclusion

Fastest in the world?
