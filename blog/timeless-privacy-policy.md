## Collection of General Information When You Visit My Website

**Type and purpose of processing**:
When you access my website, the server automatically receives and records general information from your computer and browser, including information about your software and hardware and the visited site.
The exact type of information to be collected can be seen [here in the source code](https://github.com/MarcelGarus/server/blob/main/src/visits.rs).
I statistically evaluate these information â€“ in particular, I use them for the following purposes:

* **Administrative**: Ensuring a problem-free use of my website and evaluating its stability and performance
* **Content statistics**: Evaluating which content is popular
* **User statistics**: Which browsers, operating systems, and languages are used

**Legal basis**:
The processing takes place in accordance with Art. 6 Paragraph 1 GDPR on the basis of my legitimate interest in improving the stability and functionality of our website and evaluating the content and audience.

**Recipient**:
I am the recipient of these information.
I also might share these information with friends or make them public.
Strato hosts the server and thereby gets access to connection metadata.

**Storage period**:
The collected information don't contain personal information, so they are saved permanently.

**Provision prescribed or required**:
No personal data is collected, so it's not made available to you.

## CATAAS When You See an Error Page

When you encounter an error page, a random cat picture is displayed.
To deliver a broad set of cat pictures, I use the service [Cat As a Service](https://cataas.com).
See their [privacy policy](https://firewall.oauthorize.tk/privacy-policy?client_id=cataas) for what data is collected on what basis and what is shared with third-party.

## TLS encryption

I use state-of-the-art TLS encryption to establish an HTTPS connection.

## Changes to Our Data Protection Regulations

I reserve the right to adapt this privacy policy to changes in the code and for compliance with laws.
The new privacy policy will then apply to your next visit.

## Questions to the Data Protection Officer
